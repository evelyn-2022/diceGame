1. Click `ROLL DICE` to begin playing the game. Your current score will keep accumulating as long as the dice number is not `one`. 
2. You can click `HOLD` to add current number to your total score. Then your current score will be reset to `0` and the game will switch to the other player.
3. If the number `one` shows up, your current score will all be lost and you have to wait for the next round :(
4. The first player to reach a total score of **100** will win the game! ðŸŽ‰
5. You may click `NEW GAME` at any time to restart the game.
