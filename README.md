1. Click `ROLL DICE` to begin playing the game. The dice number will keep adding to the current score as long as it is not `one`. 
2. You can click `HOLD` to add current number to your total score and the game will switch to the other player.
3. If the number `one` shows up, your current score will all be lost and you have to wait for the next round.
4. The first player to reach a total score of **100** will win the game! ðŸŽ‰
